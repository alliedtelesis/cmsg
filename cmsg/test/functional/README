The functional tests are intended to test the end-to-end functionality of the CMSG library.

Common gotchas / reasons for test failures that aren't related to the library code:

- The localhost loopback address (127.0.0.1) is not routable. Ensure that a route
  for this address exists on the system running the tests.

- The TIPC module is not loaded in the system running the tests. Load the module using
  "sudo modprobe tipc".
